# Automating AWS Infrastructure with Terraform and Ansible: A Step-by-Step Guide

In today's world of cloud computing, automating infrastructure deployment and management is crucial for efficiency, scalability, and reliability. In this blog post, I'll walk you through my GitHub repository, [AWS-Terraform-Ansible-IaC](https://github.com/Sareenh1/AWS-Terraform-Ansible-IaC), which demonstrates how to use **Terraform** and **Ansible** together to automate AWS infrastructure deployment.

## What is this project about?

This repository provides a hands-on example of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using two powerful tools:
- **Terraform**: For provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Ansible**: For configuration management and application deployment.

By combining these tools, you can automate the entire lifecycle of your infrastructure, from creating cloud resources to configuring servers and deploying applications.

## Key Features of the Repository

1. **Terraform for AWS Infrastructure**:
   - Automates the creation of AWS resources like VPCs, EC2 instances, security groups, and more.
   - Uses modular and reusable Terraform configurations for better maintainability.

2. **Ansible for Configuration Management**:
   - Configures EC2 instances after they are provisioned by Terraform.
   - Deploys applications, installs dependencies, and ensures the servers are ready for use.

3. **Seamless Integration**:
   - Terraform and Ansible work together seamlessly, with Terraform outputting information (like IP addresses) that Ansible uses for configuration.

4. **Easy to Use**:
   - The repository includes clear instructions and examples to help you get started quickly.

## How to Use This Repository

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Terraform
- Ansible
- AWS CLI (configured with your credentials)

### Steps to Deploy the Infrastructure

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sareenh1/AWS-Terraform-Ansible-IaC.git
   cd AWS-Terraform-Ansible-IaC
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Plan and Apply Terraform Configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Run Ansible Playbook**:
   After Terraform provisions the infrastructure, use Ansible to configure the servers:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
   ```

5. **Destroy Resources (Optional)**:
   When you're done, you can tear down the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## Why Use Terraform and Ansible Together?

- **Terraform** excels at provisioning cloud resources, but it’s not designed for configuration management.
- **Ansible** is a powerful tool for configuring servers and deploying applications but doesn’t handle cloud resource provisioning.

By combining these tools, you get the best of both worlds:
- Terraform handles the "what" (infrastructure provisioning).
- Ansible handles the "how" (server configuration and application deployment).

## Example Use Cases

This project can be adapted for various use cases, such as:
- Deploying web applications on AWS.
- Setting up development or testing environments.
- Automating the deployment of microservices architectures.
